\section{Reporting Issues}
\label{sec:reporting}
The GitHub server, on which EUDAQ is hosted, provides a system for reporting bugs and for requesting new features.
It is accessible at the following address: 

\url{https://github.com/eudaq/eudaq/issues}.

Here you may submit new reports (you are required to register first to do this),
or follow the status of existing bugs and feature requests.
This is recommended over (or at least, as well as) sending an email to the developers,
as it ensures a record of the issue is available, and others may follow the progress.
