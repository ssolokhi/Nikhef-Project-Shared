\section{Platform Dependent Issues/ Solutions}
\label{app:platform}
\subsection{Linux}
\subsubsection{GCC Compiler}
Normally, CMake takes the default GCC Compiler shipped by Linux distrubtion, even if alternative GCC tool suits exist and have prior in binary search paths.
To use an alternative GCC, it is necessary to set some CMake parameters which explicitly locate the paths of GCC binaries. Those parameters are CMAKE\_CXX\_COMPILER, CMAKE\_C\_COMPILER.
\subsubsection{LLVM/Clang}
LLVM/Clang Compiler has not been tested on Linux platform. 

\subsection{MacOS}
\subsubsection{Qt}
Install Qt5 or later, e.g. by using MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/):
\begin{listing}[mybash]
sudo port install qt5-mac-devel
\end{listing}


\subsection{Windows}
\subsubsection{Release/Debug Version}
On Windows/Visual Studio, CMake option CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE does not really affect the build type. It is possible to change the default build type Debug to Release by the build time option ``--config Release''.
\begin{listing}[mybash]
cmake --build {source_folder}/build --target install --config Release
\end{listing}

\subsubsection{Qt}
In case CMake can not find Qt5 installation at config time, set CMake option Qt5Widgets\_DIR to the folder which contaion file Qt5WidgetsConfig.cmake .
