miniTLU Producer

=== To compile

Look at cmake/FindCACTUS.cmake and change CACTUS_ROOT to point at your installation directory (/opt/cactus on SLC5/6).

If you don't use SLC5/6 you can use the script producers/miniTLU/etc/cactus_download_script_ubuntu.sh (for Ubuntu) in a tmp directory to download and extract all rpm (edit it to choose between SLC5 and SLC6 rpms) then move opt/cactus to extern/cactus. You need rpm2cpio to extract.
If you use gcc > 4.7 you may need to apply the patch producers/miniTLU/etc/boost_1_48_with_gcc_47.patch

Then:

 cd build
 cmake -DBUILD_miniTLU=ON -DIGNORE_KNOWN_ISSUES=ON ..
 make install

=== To start the program

The miniTLU executable needs uhal libraries and their dependencies in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. If these libraries are not default on your system you can copy and modify the script producers/miniTLU/etc/start_minitlu.sh to setup the environment and start the producer.

The producer needs some configuration in the .conf file:

[Producer.TLU]

# in this xml file it's specified the connection protocol and address
ConnectionFile = file://connection.xml
# the name of the connection to use
DeviceName = minitlu

# (optional) the interval in clock cycles between internally generated triggers
InternalTriggerInterval = 100000000

# (optional) DAC threshold values
DACThreshold0 = 0x4100
DACThreshold1 = 0x4100
DACThreshold2 = 0x4100
DACThreshold3 = 0x4100


Two other configuration files are needed:
- connection.xml
- miniTLU.xml

You can find these files in producers/miniTLU/etc and you must copy them in the working directory. You may want to edit connection.xml to reflect your network configuration, you don't want to edit miniTLU.xml.


=== Known bugs

The first time you connect with IPBus 1 protocol (default) it may fail. Try again. If the second time fails it's an error.
